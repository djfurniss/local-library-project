# Local Library

Welcome to your neigborhood library page! This page keeps track of a library's books, and its users accounts. 

The home page has details of the library's general stats and the most popular genres, books, and authors. Each book as well as each user also has their own detailed information. See which reader has which book! 

DOM maniuplation is used to render the stats that get their functionality from JavaScript functions.
